Therese Koch is a neuroscience PhD candidate in the [Roberts Lab](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/roberts/) at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. She studies vocal learning in zebra finches in the hopes of better understanding sensorimotor learning principles. Before starting her PhD, Therese got her BSc in Neuroscience at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, where she completed an honours project on mating preferences in another species of songbird, the bengalese finch, in the [Woolley Lab](https://sarahwoolleylab.wordpress.com/). Outside of lab, Therese is passionate about science communication and sharing her love of neuroscience and birds with anyone willing to listen.
